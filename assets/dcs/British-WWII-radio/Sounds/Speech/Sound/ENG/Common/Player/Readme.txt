****************************  DCS World 1.5   *************************

This pack contains a British Player voice for the Common sounds in DCS.  This means that when you install this mod it will overwrite the Player voice for all of the modules that use the Common voice path. I highly recommend that you back up the original Player voice folder before you install this.  I hope that this will provide greater immersion for players flying the Spitfire, but it may not feel very genuine if you are flying a Huey and you may want to replace this pack with the original.

Please bear in mind that the ATC module is exactly the same voice, just with a little static in there to simulate transmission instead of merely getting feedback from mic to headset for the Player, therefore if you use the ATC pack and the Player pack at the same time it's going to sound a lot like the pilot is talking to himself.  

To install this pack simply navigate to:


 [drive]:\Program Files (x86)\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World\Sounds\Speech\Sound\ENG\Common 


Paste the ATC folder there.  This will overwrite the default ATC folder.  It's that simple.

This pack will be overwritten with the default sounds whenever there is a DCS Patch and will have to be re-installed.
